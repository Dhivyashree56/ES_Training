1. Explain difference in flow control js and other language like python, c with example code?

	Node.js is a single-threaded event-driven platform that is capable of running non-blocking, asynchronous programming, whereas C is a multi threaded and synchornous programming language.

	C does line by line execution and execution starts from main function.  All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking, it never waits for an API to return data.


	Example:

	A function to read a file may start reading file and return the control to the execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed. Once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the file as a parameter.
	So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O. This makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process a high number of requests without waiting for any function to return results.

		Synchronous programming (In C,python):

			var fs = require("fs");
			var data = fs.readFileSync('input.txt');

			console.log(data.toString());
			console.log("Program Ended");

		Output:

			Content in the input file
			Program Ended


		Asynchronous programming:

			var fs = require("fs");
			fs.readFile('input.txt', function (err, data) {
   				if (err) return console.error(err);
   				console.log(data.toString());
			});

			console.log("Program Ended");

		Output:
			
			Program Ended
			Content in the input file
