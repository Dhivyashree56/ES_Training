// Demonstrate an example that shows that array elements can be of different types.

//JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.
//Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

console.log(person);
console.log("FirstName: "+person[0]+"\nLastName: "+person[1]+"\nAge: "+person[2]);
